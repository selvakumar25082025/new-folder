            <li>What is a Determinant?</li>
        <p>A determinant is a single scalar (numeric) value that can be calculated from the elements of a square matrix (a matrix with the same number of rows and columns). It provides crucial information about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible (non-singular, with a non-zero determinant) or not (singular, with a zero determinant).</p>
        <li>What is the inverse of a matrix?</li>
        <p>The inverse of a square matrix A, denoted as A⁻¹, is another matrix such that when A and A⁻¹ are multiplied together, the result is the identity matrix I (i.e., AA⁻¹ = A⁻¹A = I). This is analogous to a number's reciprocal, where a multiplied by 1/a equals 1. An inverse exists only for square matrices with a non-zero determinant, and such a matrix is called invertible.

    <h2>Gaussian Elimination Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a Linear Equation?</li>
        <p>A linear equation is an algebraic equation where the variables are only raised to the first power (degree 1), and each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable. When graphed, linear equations form straight lines, which is why they are called "linear".  </p>
        <li>What is Gaussian Elimination?</li>
        <p>Gaussian elimination is an algorithm that solves systems of linear equations by transforming the system's augmented matrix into an upper triangular form using elementary row operations, and then performing back-substitution to find the variable values. This method uses a series of row operations to create zeros below the leading diagonal, simplifying the system for easier solution.  </p>

    <h2>Gauss-Jordan Elimination</h2>
    <p>Gauss-Jordan elimination is an algorithm that converts a matrix into its reduced row echelon form using elementary row operations to solve systems of linear equations or find the inverse of a matrix. It refines Gaussian elimination by continuing the reduction beyond the upper triangular form to a diagonal form, where each leading 1 has zeros in all other entries in its column, directly yielding the solution.  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is Gauss–Jordan Elimination method?</li>
        <p>Gauss-Jordan elimination is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations and finding matrix inverses by transforming an augmented matrix into reduced row echelon form using elementary row operations. Unlike Gaussian elimination, which uses back-substitution after achieving upper-triangular form, Gauss-Jordan elimination continues the process until the entire matrix (on the left) becomes a diagonal matrix with leading 1s and zeros both above and below them. </p>
        <li>Steps to perform Gauss–Jordan Elimination:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Write the augmented matrix from the system of equations.</li>
            <li>Use row operations to get a leading 1 (pivot).</li>
            <li>Make all other elements zero in the pivot’s column (above and below).</li>
            <li>Repeat for all variables until you reach Reduced Row Echelon Form.</li>
            <li>Once in Reduced Row Echelon Form, read the solution directly from the matrix.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>System of Equations</li>
        
    <h2>Gauss-Jacobi Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the Gauss-Jacobi Method?</li>
        <p>The Gauss-Jacobi method, commonly known as the Jacobi method, is an iterative algorithm for finding approximate solutions to a system of linear equations. This technique is particularly useful for solving large systems where direct methods, like Gaussian elimination, are too computationally expensive. The Jacobi method updates all variables simultaneously in each iteration using values calculated in the previous step.</p>

    <h2>Gauss-Seidel Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is Gauss-Seidel Method?</li>
        <p>The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative algorithm used to solve a system of linear equations. It is an improvement upon the Gauss-Jacobi method because it uses the most recent variable approximations as soon as they are calculated, resulting in faster convergence.</p>

    <h2>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What are Eigen values and Eigen Vectors?</li>
        <p>An eigenvector of a square matrix is a non-zero vector that, when multiplied by the matrix, only changes in magnitude, not direction. The scalar factor by which the eigenvector is scaled is called its corresponding eigenvalue. This relationship is one of the most important concepts in linear algebra and is expressed by the equation:\(A\mathbf{x}=\lambda \mathbf{x}\)<br>where<br><ul>
            <li>A is a square matrix.</li>
            <li>𝐱 is the eigenvector (a non-zero vector).</li>
            <li>λ (lambda) is the eigenvalue (a scalar).</li>

        <li>What Are Subsets, Proper Subsets, and Supersets?</li>
        <p><strong>A subset (\(A\subseteq B\)) has all its elements within another set (\(B\)), which is then called the superset of \(A\). A proper subset (\(A\subset B\)) is a subset that is not equal to the superset,<br> meaning the superset must contain at least one element not found in the proper subset. </strong></p>
        <li>What is Set Operation?</li>

            <li>Set Difference (A − B) (Removing Members):</li>
            <p><strong>The set difference is like creating a custom club by removing certain members.<br> If A is the Math Club and B is the Science Club, then A − B is everyone who is in the Math Club but not in the Science Club.

        <p><strong>A partial order is a binary relation on a set where some elements are comparable and others are not</strong></p>

            <P><strong>A reflexive relation is a binary relation on a set where every element in the set is related to itself</strong></P>
            <li>Antisymmetric</li>
            <P><strong>An antisymmetric relation in mathematics is a binary relation on a set where, if two distinct elements are related in both directions, this implies those elements must be identical.</strong></P>
            <li>Transitive</li> 
            <P><strong>A transitive function is a specific type of relation where for any three elements \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the domain, if \(f(a)=b\) and \(f(b)=c\),<br> then it must also be true that \(f(a)=c\) and \(f(b)=b\) for the function to be transitive. Essentially, a function \(f\) is transitive if and only if it is the identity function (\(f(x)=x\)). </strong></P>

        <li>What is the Antisymmetric property?</li>
        <p><strong>The antisymmetric property, or antisymmetric relation, is a property of a relation where if two elements, 'a' and 'b', are related in both directions (i.e., 'a' is related to 'b' AND 'b' is related to 'a'), then 'a' and 'b' must be the same element.</strong></p>
        <li>How to visualize with a Hasse diagram?</li>
        <p><strong>To visualize with a Hasse diagram, draw each element of the partially ordered set (poset) as a point, placing smaller elements at the bottom and larger elements at the top.</strong></p>

            <li>Let’s revisit the key ideas behind the concept of relations</li>
            <li>How are graphs represented graphically?</li>
            <p><strong>Graphs are represented graphically as visual diagrams where entities are shown as nodes (or vertices) and relationships are shown as edges (or lines) connecting these nodes</strong></p>
            <li>How many relations are possible?</li>
            <P><strong>The number of possible relations depends on the context, as it can refer to different concepts. In set theory, if a set \(A\) has \(n\) elements, the total number of possible relations on \(A\) is \(2^{n^{2}}\)</strong></P>
            <li>What are the types of relations?</li>
            <p><strong>Types of relations include basic relations like the Empty Relation and Universal Relation, and properties of relations such as Reflexive, Symmetric, and Transitive</strong></p>

                <li>Reflexive Relation</li>
                <p><strong>A reflexive relation on a set is a relationship where every element of the set is related to itself</strong></p>

                <p><strong>An irreflexive relation on a set A is a binary relation where no element in A is related to itself</strong></p>
                <li> Symmetric Relation</li>
                <p><strong>A symmetric relation is a binary relation R on a set where, if element a is related to element b (written as aRb), then element b must also be related to element a (written as bRa). <br>A common example is the "is equal to" relation, because if a = b, then it's always true that b = a. </strong></p>

                <p><strong>An antisymmetric relation on a set is a binary relation where if two elements \(a\) and \(b\) are related in both directions</strong></p>
